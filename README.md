### The Position-Snapshot Approach

The OpenSky `/states/all` endpoint returns live state vectors for all aircraft globally in a single API call. Every minute the state poller fetches this snapshot, filters it to the Lufthansa fleet, and stores it in the `positions` table.

The flight detector runs every 30 minutes and walks each aircraft's position history looking for `on_ground` transitions:
- **Ground → Air** = departure (airport identified from the last ground position lat/lon)
- **Air → Ground** = arrival (airport identified from the first ground position lat/lon)

Flights that are still in progress are inserted immediately as pending records and updated when the aircraft lands — so a 14-hour flight to Buenos Aires is handled just as well as a 90-minute hop to Munich.

**Dep == Arr detection:** When a flight's detected departure and arrival airport are the same (e.g. EDDF→EDDF), it usually means the system missed the real arrival and the subsequent departure, merging two separate flights into one. These flights are closed normally but flagged with `needs_review = TRUE` so they are excluded from statistics and can be corrected manually via the [review tool](#review-tool).

Airport identification uses the [OurAirports](https://ourairports.com/) dataset (~6,000 large/medium airports) stored locally, with nearest-neighbour lookup via PostgreSQL's `earthdistance` extension.

### Why Not Per-Aircraft Queries?

OpenSky's `/flights/aircraft` endpoint charges 30 credits per call. Querying all 400+ fleet aircraft twice daily would cost **24,000+ credits/day** — 6× the 4,000 credit budget. The `/states/all` live endpoint costs a flat rate per call regardless of how many aircraft are returned, making it scale-free.

### Database Schema

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **aircraft** | Fleet registry — ICAO24, registration, type, active status, `needs_review` flag |
| **positions** | 1-minute position snapshots — lat/lon, altitude, on_ground, callsign |
| **flights** | Route log — airports, callsign, timestamps, auto-calculated duration, `needs_review` flag |
| **airports** | Static airport lookup — ICAO code, lat/lon (from OurAirports) |
| **batch_runs** | Audit trail — every job run with stats and error details |

Key design decisions:
- **Pending flights** — flights are inserted when a departure is detected with `arrival_airport_icao = NULL`, then updated when the aircraft lands. Handles flights of any duration.
- **Upsert on `(icao24, first_seen)`** — re-detecting an already-logged flight safely updates arrival info without creating duplicates.
- **Generated columns** — `flight_date` and `duration_minutes` are computed automatically from timestamps.
- **30-day position retention** — snapshots are cleaned up daily; only the derived `flights` records are kept permanently.
- **`needs_review` flags** — flights with dep == arr and aircraft with missing type/registration are flagged for manual review. Flagged records are excluded from all dashboard statistics but remain queryable for correction via the [review tool](#review-tool).

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone & configure

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ChristopherBiel/lhlogging.git && cd lhlogging
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your credentials:
#   - POSTGRES_USER / POSTGRES_PASSWORD
#   - OPENSKY_CLIENT_ID / OPENSKY_CLIENT_SECRET (from opensky-network.org account settings)
```

### 2. Launch

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This starts three containers:
- **db** — PostgreSQL 16 (schema auto-initialized from `db/init/`)
- **app** — Python 3.12 with cron for scheduled jobs
- **dashboard** — Flask app on port 8080

### 3. Load airport data (one-off)

```bash
docker compose exec app python tools/load_airports.py
```

This populates the `airports` table (~6,000 large/medium airports) used for identifying departure and arrival airports from lat/lon coordinates.

### 4. Verify

```bash
# Check services are healthy
docker compose ps

# Watch the state poller in action
docker compose logs -f app

# Open dashboard
open http://localhost:8080
```

The first state poller run happens within 1 minute of startup. The first flight detections appear within 30 minutes (after enough position history has accumulated).

---

## Configuration

All settings are environment variables (via `.env`):

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `OPENSKY_CLIENT_ID` | *(required)* | OAuth2 client ID |
| `OPENSKY_CLIENT_SECRET` | *(required)* | OAuth2 client secret |
| `POSTGRES_USER` | *(required)* | Database user |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | *(required)* | Database password |
| `TRACK_AIRCRAFT_TYPES` | *(empty = all)* | Comma-separated ICAO type codes to filter (e.g. `A388,B748`) |
| `FLIGHT_DETECT_LOOKBACK_MINUTES` | `60` | How far back the detector scans for new departures (recommended: `90`) |
| `POSITIONS_RETENTION_DAYS` | `30` | How long position snapshots are kept |
| `AIRPORT_LOOKUP_RADIUS_KM` | `50.0` | Max distance for nearest-airport matching |
| `OPENSKY_REQUEST_DELAY_S` | `2.0` | Delay between API calls |
| `OPENSKY_RATELIMIT_BACKOFF_S` | `60` | Sleep time on HTTP 429 |
| `FLIGHTAWARE_API_KEY` | *(optional)* | For `tools/eval_flightaware.py` — fleet evaluation and rebuild |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Logging verbosity |

### Tracking Subsets

To track only specific aircraft types, set `TRACK_AIRCRAFT_TYPES`:

```bash
# Only A380s and 747-8s
TRACK_AIRCRAFT_TYPES=A388,B748

# All widebodies
TRACK_AIRCRAFT_TYPES=A332,A333,A343,A345,A346,A359,A35K,A388,B744,B748,B788,B789

# Everything (default)
TRACK_AIRCRAFT_TYPES=
```

## Scheduled Jobs

| Job | Schedule | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **State Poller** | Every 1 min | Fetches `/states/all`, stores position snapshots for the LH fleet |
| **Flight Detector** | Every 30 min (at :15 and :45) | Detects flights from on_ground transitions, closes pending arrivals, flags dep==arr flights for review |
| **Fleet Discovery** | Every 6 hours | Discovers new aircraft via live DLH callsign matching (OpenSky + Planespotters) |
| **Positions Cleanup** | Daily at 04:00 UTC | Deletes position snapshots older than `POSITIONS_RETENTION_DAYS` |
| **Fleet Refresh** | Mondays at 02:00 UTC | Updates type data for existing fleet, retires decommissioned aircraft. Does **not** add new aircraft (that's fleet_discovery's job) |

---

## Dashboard

The monitoring dashboard runs on port **8080** and auto-refreshes every 30 seconds.

**What it shows:**
- System health — last run status for each job
- Fleet breakdown — active/retired aircraft counts by type
- Flight metrics — today, 7-day, and all-time counts (excludes `needs_review` flights)
- Daily trend chart — flights and unique callsigns over the last 14 days
- Top routes — most frequent city pairs (30-day window)
- Batch run history — last 10 runs with status, stats, and error details
- Fleet table — sortable/filterable list with a "Needs Review" checkbox to find aircraft missing type or registration data

---

## Deployment

Pushing to `main` triggers automatic deployment via GitHub Actions:

```
Push to main → SSH to production → git pull → docker compose up -d --build
```

Required GitHub secrets:
- `DEPLOY_HOST` — server IP/hostname
- `DEPLOY_USER` — SSH username
- `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY` — private SSH key
- `DEPLOY_PATH` — path to the repo on the server

### First-time setup on a new server

After the initial `docker compose up -d`, run the airport loader once:

```bash
docker compose exec app python tools/load_airports.py
```

### Migrating an existing deployment

Apply any new schema migrations manually before deploying the new image:

```bash
# Airports & positions (if not already applied)
ssh user@your-server "docker exec -i lhlogging-db-1 psql -U your_db_user -d lhlogging" \
  < db/init/002_airports_and_positions.sql

# needs_review flags for flights and aircraft
ssh user@your-server "docker exec -i lhlogging-db-1 psql -U your_db_user -d lhlogging" \
  < db/init/003_flights_needs_review.sql
```

Then deploy. The 003 migration also auto-flags existing aircraft that have missing type data or placeholder registrations.

---

## Fleet Management

The fleet is managed through two complementary mechanisms:

- **Fleet Discovery** (every 6h) — the sole path for adding new aircraft. Monitors live ADS-B data for DLH callsigns, discovers unknown aircraft, and enriches them via OpenSky CSV and Planespotters. Aircraft with missing type or placeholder registrations are auto-flagged `needs_review` for manual correction.
- **Fleet Refresh** (weekly) — updates type/subtype data for existing aircraft and retires those no longer in the OpenSky registry. Does **not** add new aircraft to prevent database bloat from the OpenSky CSV's broad registration-prefix matching. Clears the `needs_review` flag when enrichment fills in missing data.

**Why this separation matters:** The OpenSky CSV contains ~900+ aircraft matching `operatoricao=DLH` or `D-A*` registration prefix (including non-LH carriers like Condor, Eurowings). Allowing fleet_refresh to add aircraft would re-bloat the database. Fleet discovery uses callsign-based confirmation to ensure only genuine LH mainline aircraft are tracked.

### FlightAware AeroAPI Tool

The `tools/eval_flightaware.py` script uses the FlightAware AeroAPI (requires `FLIGHTAWARE_API_KEY` in `.env`) for fleet evaluation and one-off database rebuilds:

```bash
# Evaluate: compare FA data against current DB
docker compose exec app python tools/eval_flightaware.py

# Rebuild: truncate DB and seed with FA-confirmed D-A* aircraft
docker compose exec app python tools/eval_flightaware.py --rebuild-db

# Update: fill missing types and reactivate aircraft
docker compose exec app python tools/eval_flightaware.py --update-db
```

The rebuild mode cross-references FlightAware (source of truth for in-service aircraft) with the OpenSky CSV (source of ICAO24 hex codes needed for ADS-B tracking). Aircraft confirmed by FA but missing from the CSV are picked up by fleet_discovery within hours.

**Cost:** $10/month free credit as an ADS-B data contributor. A single evaluation run uses ~15 pages (~$0.75 estimated, though actual billing has shown $0.00).

---

## Credit Budget

| | Per call | Daily calls | Daily cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| State poller | 1 credit | 1,440 (every 1 min) | **~1,440 credits** |
| Fleet discovery | 1 credit | 4 (every 6h) | **~4 credits** |
| Fleet refresh | ~free (CSV download) | 1/week | **~0** |
| **Total** | | | **~1,444 credits/day** |

This uses **~36%** of the 4,000 credit daily budget, leaving headroom for retries and rate-limit recovery.

---

## Review Tool

Aircraft and flights that need manual attention are flagged with `needs_review = TRUE` in the database. This happens automatically when:

- **Flights:** the detected departure and arrival airport are the same (dep == arr), indicating the system likely merged two separate flights
- **Aircraft:** the type is missing or the registration is a placeholder (hex code used as registration)

Flagged records are excluded from all dashboard statistics but remain visible in detail views. To correct them, use the markdown-based review tool via SSH — no web login required.

### Workflow

```bash
# 1. SSH into the VPS and export the review queue
docker exec -it <app-container> python -m tools.review export

# 2. Edit the generated markdown file
docker exec -it <app-container> vi /app/review.md

# 3. Apply your changes back to the database
docker exec -it <app-container> python -m tools.review apply
```

You can also specify a custom file path with `--file /path/to/review.md`.

### Review file format

The exported file looks like this:

```markdown
# Review Queue

Exported: 2026-03-14 15:30 UTC

Actions:
  PENDING  — skip, keep flagged (default)
  UPDATE   — apply your edits to the database and clear the flag
  DISMISS  — clear the flag without changing any data

## Aircraft

### 3c4a52

- action: PENDING
- registration: 3C4A52
- type:
- subtype:

## Flights

### flight-1234

- action: PENDING
- icao24: 3c4a52
- registration: D-AIMC
- callsign: DLH438
- dep: EDDF
- arr: EDDF
- time: 2026-03-14 08:12 — 2026-03-14 08:45 (33min)
```

To correct an aircraft, look it up on FlightRadar24, fill in the details, and change the action:

```markdown
- action: UPDATE
- registration: D-AXYZ
- type: A320
- subtype: A320-214
```

To accept a flight or aircraft as-is (just clear the flag without editing), change the action to `DISMISS`. Entries left as `PENDING` are skipped and will appear again on the next export.
